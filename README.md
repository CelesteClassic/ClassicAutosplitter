# Classsic Autosplitter
This allows you to setup autosplitting for Celeste Classic in Linux/Mac/Windows using LiveSplit/LiveSplitOne.

## Using LiveSplit
- Download either the Pico-8 cart or the standalone from the `autosplitter-windows` folder
- Run LiveSplit and enable the autosplitter for CELESTE Classic (Edit Splits > Enable)

## Using LiveSplitOne
- Run the autosplitter python script and input "y" to say you're using LiveSplitOne
- Open https://one.livesplit.org/ in your browser, click the Connect to Server button and type `ws://localhost:5000`
-  After Pico-8 opens, run the autosplitter cart (or do nothing if you're using the standalones)

### Accuracy/Is this thing even working correctly
The python script and the Windows-only cart print all splits to the console, you can compare those times with the times the autosplitter gives (remember to check Game Time, NOT Real Time!)
